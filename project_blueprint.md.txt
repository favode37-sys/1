# Project Blueprint: PokerLingo (MVP)

## 1. Project Goal
Create a gamified poker learning app for amateurs.
**Core Philosophy:** "Duolingo for Poker".
**Visual Style:** Tactile Materialism. Clean, colorful, "juicy" UI with physics-based feedback.
**Target Audience:** Casual players, not pros.

## 2. Tech Stack (Strict Constraints)
- **Framework:** React Native (Expo SDK 52+).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **State Management:** Zustand (for simple global state like User Stack).
- **Backend/Auth:** Supabase (Auth + DB for user progress).
- **Animations:** `react-native-reanimated` (Crucial for tactile feel).
- **Gestures:** `react-native-gesture-handler`.
- **Haptics:** `expo-haptics` (Trigger on ALL interactions).
- **Navigation:** `expo-router`.

## 3. Core Mechanics: "Blitz Mode"
The user enters a rapid-fire learning session.

### Flow:
1.  **Scenario:** User sees a poker table view (simplified). Cards, position, pot size are displayed.
2.  **Action:** User has 3 distinct buttons/actions: FOLD, CALL, RAISE.
    * *Interaction:* Buttons must feel physical (press in, bounce back).
3.  **Result:**
    * **Correct:** "Chip" (Mascot) celebrates. Positive sound. Stack increases slightly (+EV).
    * **Incorrect:** An overlay appears. "Chip" explains *why* it was wrong (simple text). User's stack decreases (Health damage).
4.  **Game Over:** If Stack reaches 0, the session ends.

## 4. Visual & Audio Guidelines (The "Tactile" Feel)
- **Mascot:** "Chip" (an animated poker chip character). Must appear in Modals and Feedback screens.
- **The Stack:** The user's health is represented as a visual stack of chips. When damaged, chips physically fall off/shatter.
- **Colors:** Duolingo-inspired palette but adapted for poker.
    * Primary Action (Call/Bet): Bright, inviting Green.
    * Danger/Fold: Distinct Red/Orange.
    * Background: Clean, not the cliche "casino green felt". Use modern matte colors.
- **Feedback:** heavily rely on Haptic Feedback (Light impact on tap, Heavy impact on error).

## 5. Data Structure (Supabase)
Table: `hand_scenarios`
- `id`: uuid
- `context`: jsonb (player cards, board cards, position, pot odds)
- `correct_action`: string ('fold', 'call', 'raise')
- `explanation`: text (What Chip says if user fails)
- `difficulty`: int

## 6. Testing Strategy
- Automated agent testing script to simulate a user playing through 5 hands.
- Verify stack deduction logic on wrong answers.
